## Build
This is my first project with Rust. Build it with:
```
cargo build
```
And run with:
```
cargo run
```
## User Guide
Use left mouse to raise new lives and right mouse to kill lives.
When pausing, click on `Next` button to get next generation.
When ready, click `Start` to start the game, when the game is 
running, that button will turn to `Pause`.
